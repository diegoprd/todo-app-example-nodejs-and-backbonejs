todo example App

Description
-----------
This is a quick todo example app built with NodeJS and Backbone stack


How to run the app
-------------------
A few notes before the bullet list that everyone is looking for ;)
The app uses gulp as the build system, mongo for the DB, CommonJs for the JS modules ecosystem (for both server and client side - Thanks to http://browserify.org/) and Backbone for the frontend

So now, lets go to the Installation bullets:

1. Clone the project
2. Install mongodb if you dont already have it (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
3. Start mongodb (mongod)
4. Go to the app directory
5. Install dependencies (npm install)
6. Install gulp (npm install -g gulp)
7. run the app (gulp)
